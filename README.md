[Update Notes and Changes](https://github.com/Ove3r/Stella/blob/main/Documentation/Updates/1.0.md#stella-version-10--rewrite-release)

# Bugs, Errors, and Contributions
I am not a software designer and I do not have a wide experience nor knowledge of programming outside of design process and fundamentals. This project acts both as a learning project and a helpful tool for the Skyblock Community. I am aware of many places in my code that are either inefficient, poorly implemented, or outright disgusting. I will be doing my best to clean up the code, but if you would like to contribute, or submitt bug reports, please do so through GitHub or through the [SkyBorn Discord](https://discord.gg/GRpM4cVmaR).
